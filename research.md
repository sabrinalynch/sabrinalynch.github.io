#### Numerical Stabilization of Mass Transport in Cardiovascular Hemodynamics
Numerical simulations of cardiovascular mass transport pose significant challenges due to the wide range of Péclet numbers and backflow at Neumann boundaries. In
this work we investigated and implemented several numerical tools to address these challenges in the context of a stabilized finite element computational framework. To overcome
numerical instabilities when backflow occurs at Neumann boundaries, we proposed an approach based on the prescription of the total flux. In addition, we introduced a “consistent
flux" outflow boundary condition and demonstrate its superior performance over the traditional zero diffusive flux boundary condition. Lastly, we discussed discontinuity
capturing (DC) stabilization techniques to address the well-known oscillatory behavior of the solution near the concentration front in advection-dominated flows. The three contributions discussed
in this paper enable to successfully address commonly found challenges when simulating mass transport processes in cardiovascular flows.
